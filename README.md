Where to find more information
-----------------------------

- Quickstart on windows: Run `setup.cmd` from the repository root then run `start-dev.cmd` to start the frontend and backend in dev mode.
- Setup & development instructions: see `docs/setup.md` for step-by-step environment setup, virtual environment instructions, and how to start the frontend and backend during development.
- Question sets for the Teacher import view: example CSV files used by the Teacher UI are in the `docs/` folder (`QuestionSet.CSV`, `QuestionSet2.csv`). Use those files to populate question set we used in our demo.
- ML documentation and training commands: see `src/apps/api/brightsum_api/ml/ML_README.md` for details on the hint and correctness ML pipelines and an experimental IRT selection pipeline.
